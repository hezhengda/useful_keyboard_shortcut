All the useful shortcuts
=========================

**Notice: All the keyboard shortcut are on macbook pro keyboard, for windows the shortcut needs to be modified accordingly.**

Chrome
--------

Chrome is my go-to web browser. And I found that one extension called `vimium` very useful in navitaging through websites and tabs.

The most commonly used keyboard shortcut of `vimium` is summarized in below:

* `shift + f`: show all the possible links that we can click into; then type `esc` it will disappear.
* `shift + t`: show all the tabs that is currently open, and you can search the tab that you want to jump to.

Vim
-----

Vim is a really powerful editor and it can boost your productivity dramatically. Here are some shortcuts which I find really useful.

* Replace a word in the selected part
  * First we use visualize mode to choose the part that we want to modify (press `v` in the normal mode)
  * Then use `:s/\%V{str1}/{replace_str}/g` to make sure all the matching strings are replaced

Roam Research
---------------

I use Roam Research for the note-taking and idea-generating. I use `Roam42` as an extension for Roam.

The commonly used shortcut for Roam:
* `g`: to into the navigation mode (similar as chrome)
* `option` to jump one word; `cmd` to jump to the beginning or the end of each line.

macOS System
--------------

* I change the `esc` botton to the `caps lock` botton, so that I can do things much faster in software like `vim`, `jupyter-lab`, or even `chrome`.
